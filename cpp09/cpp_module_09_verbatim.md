## Chapter I
### Introduction

C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes" (source: Wikipedia).

The goal of these modules is to introduce you to Object-Oriented Programming.

This will be the starting point of your C++ journey. Many languages are recommended to learn OOP. We decided to choose C++ since it’s derived from your old friend C.

Because this is a complex language, and in order to keep things simple, your code will comply with the C++98 standard.

We are aware modern C++ is way different in a lot of aspects. So if you want to become a proficient C++ developer, it’s up to you to go further after the 42 Common Core!

## Chapter II
### General rules

#### Compiling
• Compile your code with c++ and the flags -Wall -Wextra -Werror  
• Your code should still compile if you add the flag -std=c++98  

#### Formatting and naming conventions
• The exercise directories will be named this way: ex00, ex01, ... , exn  
• Name your files, classes, functions, member functions and attributes as required in the guidelines.  
• Write class names in UpperCamelCase format. Files containing class code will always be named according to the class name.  
• Unless specified otherwise, every output message must end with a newline character and be displayed to the standard output.  
• Goodbye Norminette! No coding style is enforced in the C++ modules. You can follow your favorite one. But keep in mind that code your peer evaluators can’t understand is code they can’t grade. Do your best to write clean and readable code.  

#### Allowed/Forbidden
You are not coding in C anymore. Time to C++! Therefore:

• You are allowed to use almost everything from the standard library.  
• However, you can’t use any other external library. It means C++11 (and derived forms) and Boost libraries are forbidden.  
• The following functions are forbidden too: printf(), alloc() and free(). If you use them, your grade will be 0 and that’s it.  

• Note that unless explicitly stated otherwise, the using namespace <ns_name> and friend keywords are forbidden. Otherwise, your grade will be -42.  
• You are allowed to use the STL only in Modules 08 and 09.  

#### A few design requirements
• Memory leakage occurs in C++ too. When you allocate memory (by using the new keyword), you must avoid memory leaks.  
• From Module 02 to Module 09, your classes must be designed in the Orthodox Canonical Form, except when explicitly stated otherwise.  
• Any function implementation put in a header file (except for function templates) means 0 to the exercise.  
• You should be able to use each of your headers independently from others. Thus, they must include all the dependencies they need. However, you must avoid the problem of double inclusion by adding include guards. Otherwise, your grade will be 0.  

#### Read me
• You can add some additional files if you need to.  
• Sometimes, the guidelines of an exercise look short but the examples can show requirements that are not explicitly written in the instructions.  
• Read each module completely before starting! Really, do it.  
• By Odin, by Thor! Use your brain!!!

## Chapter III
### Module-specific rules

It is mandatory to use the standard containers to perform each exercise in this module.

Once a container is used you cannot use it for the rest of the module.

You must use at least one container for each exercise with the exception of exercise 02 which requires the use of two containers.

You must submit a Makefile for each program which will compile your source files to the required output with the flags -Wall, -Wextra and -Werror.

Your Makefile must not relink and must at least contain the rules $(NAME), all, clean, fclean and re.

## Chapter IV
### AI Instructions

● Context

This project is designed to help you discover the fundamental building blocks of your 42 training.

To properly anchor key knowledge and skills, it’s essential to adopt a thoughtful approach to using AI tools and support.

True foundational learning requires genuine intellectual effort — through challenge, repetition, and peer-learning exchanges.

For a more complete overview of our stance on AI — as a learning tool, as part of the 42 training, and as an expectation in the job market — please refer to the dedicated FAQ on the intranet.

● Main message

☛ Build strong foundations without shortcuts.  
☛ Really develop tech & power skills.  
☛ Experience real peer-learning, start learning how to learn and solve new problems.  
☛ The learning journey is more important than the result.  
☛ Learn about the risks associated with AI, and develop effective control practices and countermeasures to avoid common pitfalls.  

● Learner rules:
• You should apply reasoning to your assigned tasks, especially before turning to AI.  
• You should not ask for direct answers to the AI.  
• You should learn about 42 global approach on AI.

## Chapter V
### Exercise 00: Bitcoin Exchange

Exercise: 00  
Bitcoin Exchange  

Directory: ex00/  
Files to Submit: Makefile, main.cpp, BitcoinExchange.{cpp, hpp}  
Forbidden: None  

You have to create a program which outputs the value of a certain amount of bitcoin on a certain date.

This program must use a database in csv format which will represent bitcoin price over time. This database is provided with this subject.

The program will take as input a second database, storing the different prices/dates to evaluate.

Rules:
• The program name is btc.  
• Your program must take a file as an argument.  
• Each line in this file must use the following format: "date | value".  
• A valid date will always be in the following format: Year-Month-Day.  
• A valid value must be either a float or a positive integer, between 0 and 1000.  

If the date used in the input does not exist in your DB then you must use the closest date contained in your DB. Be careful to use the lower date and not the upper one.

You must use at least one container in your code to validate this exercise.

## Chapter VI
### Exercise 01: Reverse Polish Notation

Exercise: 01  
RPN  

Directory: ex01/  
Files to Submit: Makefile, main.cpp, RPN.{cpp, hpp}  
Forbidden: None  

Your program must take an inverted Polish mathematical expression as an argument.

The numbers used in this operation and passed as arguments will always be less than 10.

Your program must process this expression and output the correct result on the standard output.

Your program must be able to handle operations with these tokens: + - / *.

If an error occurs during the execution of the program an error message should be displayed on the standard error.

You must use at least one container in your code to validate this exercise.

You don’t need to handle brackets or decimal numbers.
Here is an example of standard usage:
$> ./RPN "8 9 * 9 - 9 - 9 - 4 - 1 +"
42
$> ./RPN "7 7 * 7 -"
42
$> ./RPN "1 2 * 2 / 2 * 2 4 - +"
0
$> ./RPN "(1 + 1)"
Error
$>

## Chapter VII
### Exercise 02: PmergeMe

Exercise: 02  
PmergeMe  

Directory: ex02/  
Files to Submit: Makefile, main.cpp, PmergeMe.{cpp, hpp}  
Forbidden: None  

You must create a program with these constraints:
• The name of the program is PmergeMe.
• Your program must be able to use a positive integer sequence as an argument.
• Your program must use the merge-insert sort algorithm to sort the positive integer sequence.

To clarify, yes, you need to use the Ford-Johnson algorithm.
(source: Art Of Computer Programming, Vol.3. Merge Insertion, Page 184.)

• If an error occurs during program execution, an error message should be displayed on the standard error.

You must use at least two different containers in your code to
validate this exercise. Your program must be able to handle at least 3000 different integers.

It is strongly advised to implement your algorithm for each container and thus to avoid using a generic function.

Here are some additional guidelines on the information you should display line by line on the standard output:
• On the first line you must display an explicit text followed by the unsorted positive integer sequence.
• On the second line you must display an explicit text followed by the sorted positive integer sequence.
• On the third line, you must display an explicit message indicating the time taken by your algorithm, specifying the first container used to sort the positive integer sequence.
• On the last line you must display an explicit text indicating the time used by your algorithm by specifying the second container used to sort the positive integer sequence. 

The format for the display of the time used to carry out your sorting is free but the precision chosen must allow to clearly see the difference between the two containers used.

Here is an example of standard use:
$> ./PmergeMe 3 5 9 7 4
Before: 3 5 9 7 4
After: 3 4 5 7 9
Time to process a range of 5 elements with std::[..] : 0.00031 us
Time to process a range of 5 elements with std::[..] : 0.00014 us
$> ./PmergeMe`shuf -i 1-100000 -n 3000 | tr "\n" " "`
Before: 141 79 526 321 [...]
After: 79 141 321 526 [...]
Time to process a range of 3000 elements with std::[..] : 62.14389 us
Time to process a range of 3000 elements with std::[..] : 69.27212 us
$> ./PmergeMe "-1" "2"
Error
$> # For OSX USER:
$> ./PmergeMe`jot -r 3000 1 100000 | tr'\n' ' '`
[...]
$>

The indication of the time is deliberately strange in this example.
Of course you have to indicate the time used to perform all your operations, both the sorting part and the data management part.

The management of errors related to duplicates is left to your discretion.

## Chapter VIII
### Submission and peer-evaluation

Turn in your assignment in your Git repository as usual. Only the work inside your repository will be evaluated during the defense.
